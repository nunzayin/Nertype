Nertype language is a constructed (opposing natural) literary language or *conlang* for short.
It was inspired by toki pona, lojban and my own experience in using programming languages.
My goal was to create a minimalistic yet expressive language without ambiguity.

> We can be vague, but not ambiguous.

The language itself is described in resulting [pdf file](./Nertype.pdf).
